## TODO
1. Create tests for `services/` and finish development of both services -> waiting for `sandbox` access;
2. Add CI automated tests on commit, run tests and coverage report;
3. Setup a Azure freetier account (maybe use Terraform or other IaC tool?);
4. Deploy `services` and the `starkbank_integration` package into a cloud provider;
